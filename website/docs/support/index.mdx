# How to get help for the xPack Project

## Quick tips

The **xPack Project** consists of multiple individual
projects, each hosted on its own GitHub repository. Therefore, the best
way to get answers quickly is to use the
GitHub Discussions
pages for the specific project you're interested in.

## Web pages issues

If you encounter any issues in the content of these pages (such as typos or
incorrect phrasing) or have suggestions for improving the documentation,
please share them through the
GitHub Discussions pages. Use the top-level
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/discussions)
page for issues related to the main xPack Project site, or the individual project's GitHub Discussions pages for specific projects.
Be sure you provide the full URL of the page, clearly identify the
part with the problematic section, and suggest improvements.

## Check documentation

As usual, before asking anything, it is a good idea to check the project
documentation.

<Documentation/>

## Preliminary checks

Before posting any questions or providing feedback,
check if the subject was not already addressed.


- Check the GitHub Discussions for
similar topics
- Check the 
GitHub Issues
tracker and the
GitHub Pull Requests
for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still cannot find a solution, have interesting use cases,
custom configurations, or any experiences you wish to share with
others, please 
use the top-level
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/discussions)
page for questions related to the top xPack Project. For specific projects,
use the individual project's GitHub Discussions pages.
Start a **New discussion**; use the **Q&A** category for questions,
**Ideas** for suggestions and **General** for everything else.

## Stack Overflow

For community help, you can also use
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
Tag your questions with `xpack`.

:::tip

Please be aware that there is another tag `elastic-x-pack` for a different
project, and some of their questions are tagged with `xpack` too.

## The Discord channel

For live discussions among members, join the **xPack Community** on
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kbzWaJerFG).

Currently, there are three channels available:

- `#xpm`
- `#xcdl`
- `#xpack-dev-tools`
- `#general`

These channels are open for free discussions on their respective topics.

However, for support, please use GitHub Discussions whenever possible.

## X/Twitter

New releases and other announcements are posted on
[X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/xpack_project).

Follow the hashtag `#xpack_project` for the latest updates.

## Use of private e-mail

:::caution Please, please, please!

**Do not** use
private e-mail for support; instead, **use the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/discussions)** pages.

:::

Private messages will receive an automated reply containing a link
to this page. This approach is not intended to be discourteous, but
rather to optimise time efficiency; as discussions are archived,
others facing similar issues may benefit from the provided answers.
