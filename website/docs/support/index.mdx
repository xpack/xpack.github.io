# How to get help for the xPack Project


## Quick tips

The **xPack Project** consists of multiple individual
projects, each hosted on its own GitHub repository. Therefore, the best
way to get answers quickly is to use the
GitHub Discussions
pages for the specific project you're interested in.


## Web pages issues

If you find any issues in the content of these pages (such as typos or
incorrect phrasing) or have suggestions for improving the documentation,
please share them through the
GitHub Discussions pages. Use the top-level
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/discussions)
page for issues related to the main xPack Project site, or the individual projectâ€™s GitHub Discussions pages for specific projects.

## Check documentation

As usual, before asking anything, it is a good idea to check the project
documentation.

<Documentation/>

## Preliminary checks

Before posting any questions or providing feedback,
check if the subject was not already addressed.

- check the FAQ
for similar problems
- check the GitHub Discussions for
similar topics
- check the
GitHub Issues
tracker and the
GitHub Pull Requests
for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, 
use the top-level
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/discussions)
page for questions related to the top xPack Project. For specific projects,
use the individual project's GitHub Discussions pages.
Enter a **New discussion**; use the **Q&A** category for questions,
**Ideas** for suggestions and **General** for everything else.



## Stack Overflow

For community help, you can also use
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
Tag your questions with `xpack`.

:::tip

Please be aware that there is another tag `elastic-x-pack` for a different
project, and some of their questions are tagged with `xpack` too.

:::

## The Discord channel

For live discussions among members, join the **xPack Community** on
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kbzWaJerFG).

Currently, there are three channels available:

- `#xpm`
- `#xcdl`
- `#xpack-dev-tools`
- `#general`

These channels are open for free discussions on their respective topics.

However, for support, please use GitHub Discussions whenever possible.

## X/Twitter

New releases and other announcements are posted on
[X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/xpack_project).

Follow the hashtag `#xpack_project` for the latest updates.

## Use of private e-mail

:::caution Please, please, please!

**Do not** use
private e-mail for support, **use the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpack.github.io/discussions)** pages.

:::

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a short message including a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
