The **xPack** project received its name in 2017, but it actually originated
in 2012, when it was named **xcdl**, and a Python experimental implementation
of the **eCos CDL** was written.

## The early years and the tight relation to µOS++

The history of the **xPack** project was deeply intertwined with
[the history of µOS++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io/project/history/),
as it was initially intended to **automate the building** and running
**multi-platform unit tests** for [µOS++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io).
Later, it was also used to build the binary xpm packages, which further
validated the concept.

To avoid redundancy, the full story is not replicated here, so please
read [the history of µOS++](http://micro-os-plus.github.io/project/history/)
before continuing; the brief list of the important events is:

- [eCos CDL](http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-1.3.1/cdl/language.html)
  was the inspiration for a component based design (early 2000s).
- In 2013, the **GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins** (later rebranded as the
  [Eclipse Embedded CDT](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io))
  was the first attempt to find a solution that avoids generating **make**
  files by hand, but this prevented the building and running of unit tests in
  a scriptable environment.
- In 2013, the experimental [XCDL](http://xcdl.github.io)
  (eXtended Components Definition Language) project, inspired by
  eCos CDL, implemented in Python, validated the concept.
  :::note
    The major weakness of this XCDL implementation was the
    limitation introduced by
    having the build configuration metadata as a Python code:
    **it could be edited only manually**, and not via a GUI based
    IDE (compared, for example, to the C/C++ settings in Eclipse CDT,
    which writes back the XML configuration file)".
  :::
- In 2014, the **CMSIS Packs** solution was evaluated, and an
  Eclipse plug-in was
  created to manage them. However the solution was later found to have
  too many design issues, and was abandoned.
- In 2015, the [yotta](https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta) solution was
  considered, and the first XCDL packs based on yotta were tested.
  For various reasons, **yotta** was later abandoned by Arm.
  :::note
    As yotta was
    strongly influenced by **npm**, the npm ecosystem was considered
    a good starting point for a future solution.
  :::
- In 2017, the first release of **xpm** was made available as a complementary
  solution to **npm**, and packages
  managed by it were named **xPacks**; **xpm** complements
  [npm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)) as the industry
  standard package manager for JavaScript packages, and uses the same
  [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) as the hugely popular public
  package repository.
- In 2019, **xpm** was extended to also support
  installing binary packages, and a new class of tools was created as
  [xPack Binary Development Tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/).
- In 2022, **xpm** was used to build the binary packages, proving that
  **the technology is standalone**, with the newer versions of the tools
  being built with existing xPacks.
- In 2023, with most of the tools in place, a first C/C++ project
  ([@micro-os-plus/utils-lists](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack/))
  was fully tested via **xpm**, once again validating the whole concept.

## The xPack Project goals

The project came to life out of a practical need to find a replacement
for the Eclipse CDT managed build, with the additional requirement of
being able to run unit tests in a scriptable environment.

:::note

In the beginning, it seemed easy, but it later proved to be quite a
challenge and required defining sub-goals and achieving them in sequence.

:::

Through trial and error, the main aspects that need to be addressed by
such a solution were identified as:

- The **build** (defining which files enter the build, the compiler/linker
  options, etc).
- The **application configuration** (e.g. managing the values of the #define
  in a consistent way).
- The **tools** (toolchains, debuggers, emulators, etc).

## The XCDL experimental version

The first experimental solution was [XCDL](http://xcdl.github.io),
which was used in the **µOS++ Second Edition**.
Essentially, some of the
[eCos CDL](http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-1.3.1/cdl/language.html)
functionality was implemented in Python.

The result looked like this:

- [meta/xcdl.py](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-ii/blob/master/packages/portable/core/meta/xcdl.py)

The implementation was quite easy, and worked pretty well.

However several issues were identified:

- Using configuration files written in a programming language was
  convenient, but it had a major drawback: since parsing Python
  is not trivial, it prevented the configuration
  being edited with a GUI tool (similar to the Eclipse settings pages).
  In other words, **the configuration
  files must be in a structured format**; otherwise editing them by a
  machine is problematic.
- Although the µOS++ SE was more or less modular, the project was
  basically a **mono-repo**, making it **difficult to write unit tests
  for each module**.
- Running unit tests with several toolchains, not to
  mention different versions of the same toolchain, proved
  extremely difficult. Doing this on multiple platforms
  (macOS, Windows, GNU/Linux) was even more challenging.

The lessons learned from this experiment were:

- If a configuration needs to be edited by a machine,
  it must be written in a **structured format**, with
  **JSON** being the preferred choice.
- If each module is expected to be tested, it is better
  to use **multiple small repositories**, each with its CI tests.
- If the project is split into multiple packages, a tool to automate
  the installation and management of dependencies is a great addition.
- Toolchains and other tools need to be **standalone and relocatable**,
  allowing multiple versions to be installed in different folders on
  the same machine. Managing these multiple tools can also be automated
  with a tool.

## Binary xpm packages

The first binary tools prepared were **arm-none-eabi-gcc**, **openocd**,
**qemu** and **windows-build-tools**. They were also used in Eclipse project.
Initially, they were installed manually, and Eclipse was able to
identify them in certain fixed location.

## npm/xpm

While searching for a solution to automate the installation of different
source packages, **npm** appeared to be a close fit.

However, using **npm** directly proved to be an unfortunate solution,
as **npm**'s strategy for installing dependencies is specific to
JavaScript, with hierarchical packages.

Therefore, it was decided that a new tool was needed, primarily to
handle the linear dependencies of C/C++. This is how **xpm** was
created. Although it preserves the general look and feel and design
concepts of **npm**, it is not a replacement for **npm**.


Later, **xpm** was extended to automate the installation of
toolchains and other binary archives.

As of now, there are toolchains for Arm, AArch64, RISC-V, and
native (GCC & clang) that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
It is probably fair to say that the tools part of the project is
properly covered and fully automated.

## Build system generators

As for the build and configuration tools in the project, work
is still in progress.

For the build, the initial idea was to rewrite the Python code
in JavaScript, but a step-by-step approach was later considered.

In the first step, existing build system generators like **CMake**
and **Meson** were used, offering several advantages:

- They allow tests to be added to the µOS++ projects immediately,
  without waiting for any special or future tools.
- They provide a valuable opportunity to gain experience in
  organising projects with such tools.
- They offer users a direct way to integrate the µOS++ source
  code libraries into their existing projects built with CMake
  or Meson.

To manage the multi-platform, multi-architecture, multi-version, and
other varied tests, a tool to manage **multiple build configurations**
was needed. Since each configuration requires its own tools, with
different versions, it became clear that the build configurations
must be managed by the same tool. Therefore, **xpm** was extended
to handle multiple **build configurations**. Later, **xpm actions**
were added to automate running sequences of commands, such as CMake
or Meson, to build and run the tests.

## Future plans

### µOS++

As of mid-2023, the project is quite advanced, but it is not yet complete.

In the future (2025), it is planned that all the
[µOS++ projects](https://github.com/micro-os-plus)
to be updated to use
the multiple build configurations automated by **xpm**,
ensuring everything is fully tested in µOS++.

With the experience gained from this step, the next step is to finalise the
specifications for the xPack CDL, which will handle the configuration and
build processes.

The tool will probably be called **xcdl**,
and will use json files, with a content similar to this one:

- [xcdl.json](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack/blob/xpack-development/xcdl.json)

As it can be seen, this file defines the **include folders**,
the **source files**, and some
**preprocessor definitions** that might be enabled while
building the project.

This file, along with all other similar files from the packages that
are part of the project, will provide the input data for a tree of
**components** that can be rendered in a graphical tool like VS Code.
This allows for project configuration in a manner similar to, or
possibly even more advanced than, the **Eclipse CDT** settings.
The hierarchical components reflect the logical structure of the
application and enable the automatic management of dependencies
between components and configuration options.

### Visual Studio Code

Additions to the **VS Code xPack extension** are planned with features
to edit the tree of xPack CDL components and run the builds directly,
without CMake/Meson. This will be a true xPack-enabled tool and an
alternative solution to Eclipse Embedded CDT.

However, the use of this tool should be **optional**. The entire
functionality should also be available from a terminal and a
plain text editor.

## Conclusions

The xPack Project originated from **the need to
automate the workflow for existing open-source projects**, particularly
the execution of multiple tests for embedded projects, which often poses
more challenges than developing the projects themselves.

## To be continued...
