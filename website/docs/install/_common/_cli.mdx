### Quick instructions

For those who have already performed the install steps on the
[xPack Prerequisites](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page and are
familiar with the process, here are the commands you need.
Simply copy and paste them into your terminal (hover the mouse
over the command, and a **copy button** will appear on
the right side; click it to copy the command).

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

Download the Windows **Prebuilt Installer** (a `node-v*-x64.msi` file) from the
[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
page and install it as usual, with administrative rights.
**Avoid** selecting the **Tools for Native Modules** during installation.

Although not mandatory, it is recommended to update **npm** to the
latest version:

```txt
npm install -location=global npm@latest
```

Update the user `Path` and make it persistent:

```txt
set Path=%APPDATA%\npm;%Path%
setx Path "%APPDATA%\npm;%Path%"
```

Configure PowerShell to allow the execution of node.js applications:

```txt
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

To install **node** via the **nvm** version manager,
run the following script through your shell:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpack/assets/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh | ${SHELL}

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

This script, in addition to installing **node** and **npm**,
also installs **xpm**.

## Install



With the environment properly set, the command to install **web-preview-docusaurus** is:

```sh
npm install --location=global web-preview-docusaurus@latest
```

This command installs the latest available version.

To install a specific version, mention it explicitly:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`npm install --location=global web-preview-docusaurus@${customField('releaseVersion')}
`} </CodeBlock>

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

On Windows, global Node.js packages are installed in the
user home folder, in `%APPDATA%\npm`
(like `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\npm`), and managing packages
does not require administrative rights.

The result of installing **web-preview-docusaurus** is a set of files in the `%APPDATA%\npm` folder:

```txt
C:\>dir "%APPDATA%"\npm\*
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is B02D-925C

 Directory of C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\npm

29/07/2024  07:24               397 
29/07/2024  07:24               329 .cmd
29/07/2024  07:24               821 .ps1
               3 File(s)          1,547 bytes
               0 Dir(s)  39,088,439,296 bytes free
```

If you followed the instructions in the
prerequisites section, you should
already have this path configured and the program should start normally:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`C:\> --version
${customField('releaseVersion')}
`} </CodeBlock>

<TroubleshootingWindows />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

On macOS, if you ran the `install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh` scripts described
in the previous section, you should
already have **npm** correctly configured to use a location in the home folder.

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`% which 
/Users/ilg/.nvm/versions/node/${props.nodeVersion}/bin/
`} </CodeBlock>

To test if **** starts:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`%  --version
${customField('releaseVersion')}
`} </CodeBlock>

<Heading as="h3">Show macOS hidden files</Heading>

The default location used to install the global packages is
below `~/Library`, a folder that, due to an unfortunate Apple decision,
is hidden for regular browsing in Finder.

To make it back visible, use:

```sh
/usr/bin/chflags nohidden ~/Library
xattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo ~/Library
```

A more general solution is to make all hidden files visible:

```sh
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true
killall Finder
```

Another annoying behaviour of the file browser is to hide names starting
with `.` (dot), which is a real pity since the binary packages are
extracted in a folder named `.content`.

Fortunately there is a workaround for this too:

```console
cmd+shift+'.'
```

This keyboard shortcut works like a toggle, using it once makes files
starting with dot visible,
using it again reverts to hiding them.

<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

On GNU/Linux, by default, when using system packages,
global Node.js packages are installed in
`/usr/local`, and managing them requires administrative rights,
but if you ran the `install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh` scripts described
in the previous section, you should
already have **npm** correctly configured to use a location in the home folder.



To test if  starts:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`$ which 
/home/ilg/.nvm/versions/node/${props.nodeVersion}/bin/
$  --version
${customField('releaseVersion')}
`} </CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Uninstall

The command to remove **web-preview-docusaurus** is:

```sh
npm uninstall --location=global web-preview-docusaurus
```

<NoAdministrativeRights />

## npx

If, for any reason, you decide not to install **web-preview-docusaurus**, you can still
benefit from it by using the `npx` command, as a trampoline to start ****:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`$ npx  --version
${customField('releaseVersion')}
`} </CodeBlock>

However, for regular usage, this method is not efficient, since
**npx** will need to prepare the Node.js module
for each run, and this takes some time.

[npm-folders](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders).
