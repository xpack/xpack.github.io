# Terms used across the xPack Project

### xPack

This term should primarily be understood as a **generic name** for
the top project (**The xPack Reproducible Build Framework**,
**The xPack Framework**, or simply **The xPack Project**).

Etymologically, **xPack** can be considered to be a short form
for **xpm package**, or **extended package**, which is technically
a **npm package** with additional
`xpack` definitions to store the **xpm** metadata.

### Reproducibility

For software development,
[reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)
is the characteristic of a development framework that ensures stability
over time and across platforms, allowing the same builds or tests to be
executed repeatedly with identical results.

### xpm

**xpm** stands for the **xPack Project Manager**. It is a Node.js CLI
application. It is NOT a replacement for **npm**, but rather complements its
functionality with features specific to
compiled languages such as C and C++.

### npm

Although the existing documentation does not acknowledge the acronym, **npm**
stands for the **Node.js Package Manager**.

### Node.js

**Node.js** is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
environment designed for CLI and server applications.

### CLI

**CLI** stands for **Command-Line Interface**. When used with
program names, it indicates that the program runs in a computer terminal
rather than a graphical user interface.

### npmjs.com

**[npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com)** is the public repository for Node.js
packages. Access is free, and it hosts millions of packages, with
tens of billions of downloads every week.

### CDL

by eCos and is documented in
[The eCos Component Writer's Guide](http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-3.0/cdl-guide/cdl-guide.html).

### xCDL

**xCDL** stands for the **xPack Configuration Definition Language**,
inspired by CDL.
