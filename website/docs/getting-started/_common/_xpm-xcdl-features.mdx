By design, the xPack Framework aims to automate:

- managing **dependencies**
- managing **build configurations**
- the **component configurations** process
- the **build** process

:::tip

Dependencies & build configurations are managed by
**[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)**,
while the configuration & build processes are handled by
**[xcdl](https://xpack.github.io/xcdl/)**.
