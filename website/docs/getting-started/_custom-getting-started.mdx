## Mission statement

:::info Our Mission

Enable developers to efficiently **manage dependencies**
and **multi-configuration builds**, in a **reproducible** way.

:::

Based on a straightforward multi-version dependencies manager
built on top of **npm**, the xPack Project aims to provide a
suite of cross-platform tools. These tools are designed to manage,
**configure**, **build** and **test** complex, modular,
**multi-target** projects (encompassing multiple architecture,
boards and toolchains), in a **reproducible** way, with a
particular focus on **C/C++** and **bare-metal embedded** projects.

## Features

By design, the xPack Framework aims to automate:

- managing **dependencies**
- managing **build configurations**
- the **component configurations** process
- the **build** process

:::tip

The management of dependencies & build configurations is handled by **xpm**
and the configuration & build processes are covered by **xcdl**.

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity**: By providing a suite of
cross-platform tools, the project streamlines the management,
configuration, building, and testing processes, saving time
and reducing the complexity involved in handling multi-target projects.
2. **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that builds and tests can be
executed repeatedly with identical results across different
platforms and over time enhances the reliability and stability
of the development process.
3. **Modularity and Flexibility**: The focus on complex, modular
projects allows for better organization and scalability. Developers
can work on individual components without affecting the entire
system, facilitating easier maintenance and updates.
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tools designed to work across
various architectures, boards, and toolchains ensure that the
project can be adapted to different environments, making it
versatile and adaptable to various development needs.
5. **Specialization in C/C++ and Bare-Metal Embedded Projects**:
By targeting specific areas like C/C++ and bare-metal embedded
projects, the tools can offer specialized features and optimizations
that cater to the unique requirements of these domains.
6. **Improved Code Sharing and Reuse**: The use of a multi-version
dependencies manager built on top of npm promotes better code sharing
and reuse, enhancing collaboration and reducing duplication of effort
throughout the project lifecycle.


:::info Benefits

These benefits collectively contribute to a more efficient,
reliable, and adaptable development process, ultimately
leading to **higher quality software** and **faster time-to-market**.

## Install

The **xPack Project core tools** can be installed automatically,
using the `npm` command.

The **xPack Binary Development Tools** can be installed automatically,
using the `xpm` command
(the recommended method), or manually, by downloading and unpacking one of the
platform specific archives.

Please refer to the **Install Guide** pages for each project.
