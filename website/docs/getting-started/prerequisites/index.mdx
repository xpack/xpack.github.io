# How to install the xPack prerequisites

## Overview

All xPack core tools are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) CLI application
available from the
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) public repository. They can be installed
via `npm`, which runs on top of **Node.js**.

## Install Node.js & npm

The only prerequisite for xPack is a recent version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=**{customField('enginesNodeVersion')}**), as
some dependencies require new features. Detailed instructions
for each supported platform are provided in the following sections.

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`$ node --version
v${frontMatter.node_version}
`} </CodeBlock>

If this is your first time using **npm**, you'll need to install the
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ECMAScript (JavaScript) runtime.
The installation process is
straightforward and does not clutter system locations.
There are two versions of Node.js: **LTS** (**Long Term Service**) and
**Current**. Generally, it is safer to use the **LTS** version,
especially on Windows.

![The Node Download page](./img/nodejs-org.png)

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

For Windows, the general procedure is to download the package
and run the setup as usual (see below for details).

The result is a binary program named `node.exe`,
that can be used to execute
JavaScript code from the terminal, and a stub named `npm.cmd`, executing
the `npm-cli.js` script, which is part of the Node.js module that implements
the `npm` functionality.

<Heading as="h3"><code>node</code> setup</Heading>

Download the Windows **Prebuilt Installer** from the Node.js
[download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
page (a `node-v*-x64.msi` file,
only x64 is supported) and run the Windows setup as usual,
with administrative rights.

:::tip

If you are not developing native modules, it's best to **skip** selecting
the **Tools for Native Modules** during installation. This will help you
avoid installing Visual Studio and other large packages that you don't need.

:::

![The Node.js Tools for Native Modules](./img/nodejs-setup-tools-for-native-modules.png)

The setup process creates a folder, such as `C:\Program Files\nodejs`,
which is automatically added to the system path because it contains
the `node.exe` binary.

<CodeBlock language="txt"> {
`C:\\>where node.exe
C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe
C:\\>node --version
v${frontMatter.node_version}
`} </CodeBlock>

<Heading as ="h2"><code>npm</code> update</Heading>

Node.js comes bundled with a version of **npm**, which is typically
slightly older.

<CodeBlock language="txt"> {
`C:\\>where npm.cmd
C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.cmd
C:\\>npm --version
${frontMatter.npm_version}
`} </CodeBlock>

It is advisable to update it to the latest version:

```txt
C:\>npm install -location=global npm@latest
removed 1 package, and changed 60 packages in 5s

27 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details
```

Surprisingly, checking the version often reveals the older version:

<CodeBlock language="txt"> {
`C:\\>where npm.cmd
C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.cmd
C:\\>npm --version
${frontMatter.npm_version}
`} </CodeBlock>

This happens because, by default, global Node.js packages on Windows
are installed in the user home folder, specifically in `%APPDATA%\npm`
(e.g., `C:\Users\ilg\AppData\Roaming\npm`). This path is not included
in the system or user path.

```txt
C:\>echo %Path%
```

It must be manually added **before** the current path:

```txt
C:\>set Path=%APPDATA%\npm;%Path%
```

To make this setting **persistent**, execute the following command:

```txt
C:\>setx Path "%APPDATA%\npm;%Path%"
```

:::info

Please note the syntax differences: `setx` does not use an equal
sign but uses double quotes, which can be problematic if used with `set`.

:::

:::info

These commands are valid for the `cmd.exe` shell. For PowerShell or
other shells, please adjust the syntax accordingly.

:::

After this, the new version of the program should be visible:

<CodeBlock language="txt"> {
`C:\\>npm --version
${frontMatter.npm_latest_version}
`} </CodeBlock>

<Heading as="h2">Git</Heading>

While not mandatory for using the xPack tools alone, it is recommended
to install the [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) package too.

This also installs a `bash` shell.
The xPack Core Tools can run either in either the Windows shells or in the Git `bash` shell.

<Heading as="h2">PowerShell Execution Policies</Heading>

Recent Windows versions use PowerShell, which has a more restrictive
execution policy designed to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
Unfortunately, this also prevents the execution of Node.js applications.

If you get a message in the console as the one below:

```txt
xpm : File C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\npm\xpm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ xpm init --template @xpack/hello-world-template@latest --property lan ...
+ ~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
The terminal process "C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command xpm init --template @xpack/hello-world-template@latest --property language
```

then run the following command in a PowerShell terminal:

```txt
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

For more details please read the Microsoft
[about_Execution_Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.1) page.

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

For macOS, it is
**strongly recommended** to **use a version manager** (see below).

<UseNvm />

<Heading as="h2">Command Line Tools</Heading>

On macOS, the system C/C++ headers and most development tools are
not included in the standard macOS distribution and need to be
installed separately. Apple provides these tools as a separate
**Command Line Tools** package.

If you followed the _Quick instructions_, the `install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh`
script already installed it. Otherwise,
to install the Command Line Tools only if they are not already in the
expected location, use:

```sh
if [ ! -d "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/" ]
then
  xcode-select --install
fi
```

:::info

Please note that although the C/C++ headers
are also part of Xcode, their location is not fixed. Therefore, the
Command Line Tools package must still be installed for the xPack
toolchains to find them in the expected location.

:::

<VersionManager />

In short, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) changes the installation
location to `~/.nvm` and allows multiple versions of node to be installed
in the `~/.nvm/versions/node` folder.

If you have a previous version of **npm** installed with a local prefix,
please remove it:

```sh
npm config delete prefix
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node-modules /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/npm
rm -rf ~/Library/npm ~/opt/npm
```

Also remove `${HOME}/Library/npm/bin` or `${HOME}/opt/npm/bin` from the `PATH`.

When everything is clean, run the install script:

```sh
touch ~/.zshrc

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | ${SHELL}
```

This will install the version manager in `~/.nvm`, and add a few lines to
the shell configuration file (`.zshrc`, which must be present).

:::info

These commands were tested with `bash` on
Ubuntu, Manjaro and Raspberry Pi OS; for other environments
they may need small adjustments.

:::

<Heading as="h2">git & curl</Heading>

Although not a requirement for the node/npm/xpm tools themselves,
it is recommended to have these tools installed, especially `git`,
since all examples begin with cloning projects.

Install them according to your distribution specifics.

For example on Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, use:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes git curl
```

<Heading as="h2">The GCC development headers and libraries</Heading>

While the node/npm/xpm tools themselves do not require it, if you
use the xPack native toolchains for software development, including for
running tests natively, you will need the **system C/C++ headers and libraries**.

The commands to install them are distribution specifics. For
example on Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, use:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes g++ libc6-dev libstdc++6
```

To compile 32-bit application on 64-bit Intel systems, the **multilib**
package is necessary:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes g++-multilib
```

For some applications, the kernel headers are also necessary:

```sh
sudo apt-get install --yes linux-headers-generic
```

## Cleanups (node/npm)

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

If installed as recommended via setup, **node** can be uninstalled via the
Microsoft specific mechanisms.

For a comprehensive cleanup, please be aware that **npm** utilises the
following two folders to install global packages:

- `%APPDATA%\Roaming\npm`
- `%APPDATA%\Local\npm-cache`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

For a comprehensive cleanup, please be aware that **nvm**, **node**,
and **npm** utilise only two folders:

- `$HOME/.nvm`
- `$HOME/.cache/node`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="GNU/Linux">

For a comprehensive cleanup, please be aware that **nvm**, **node**,
and **npm** utilise only two folders:

</Tabs>

## Install xpm

[`xpm`](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/) is also a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

On macOS and GNU/Linux, if you followed the _Quick instructions_,
it is already installed. Otherwise, to install it, follow the steps in the
[xpm install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If you're confident and prefer a shortcut,
run the following command:

```sh
npm install -location=global xpm@latest
```

## Miscellaneous

The official page explaining how to install **npm** in a custom folder is
[Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

For less common platforms, you can install from unofficial
builds, or to compile it from sources. For more details, see the
[Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page.
