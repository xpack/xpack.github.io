## Challenge

First-time readers may find it difficult to understand the rationale
behind the xPack Project. Therefore, presenting them with a challenge
could be advantageous.

<details>
<summary>Imagine you have a highly successful project featuring a
**portable C/C++ library** that you wish to have **thoroughly tested**
before each release...</summary>

... You already have a comprehensive set of **unit tests** and you
aim to execute them across a **wide range of configurations,
platforms, and toolchains**.

Thus, the challenge is to find a solution that allows to:

- Perform the tests on **Windows**, **macOS** (x64/arm64), and
**GNU/Linux** (x64/arm64).
- Run the tests on **native** platforms (Windows, macOS,
GNU/Linux) as well as on various **bare-metal embedded**
platforms (such as Cortex-M0/M3/M7/A15/A76, RISC-V 32/64-bit).
- Build the tests using **multiple versions** of GCC and Clang.
- Execute the tests on the local development machine and in
widely-used **CI/CD environments** like GitHub Actions.

Please participate in the
**[poll](https://github.com/orgs/xpack/discussions/12)** and, if you
have a solution, kindly describe it in
**[The xPack challenge](https://github.com/orgs/xpack/discussions/categories/the-xpack-challenge)**
category.

Then you can compare your solution with the
**[xPack approach](https://github.com/orgs/xpack/discussions/14)**
to this challenge.

The tools in the xPack Project can automate various aspects of the
development process, with testing being perhaps the most prominent.

If you wish to learn more about these features or if this challenge
resonates with your testing experience, please continue reading.

## Mission statement

:::info Our Mission

Enable developers to efficiently **manage dependencies**
and **multi-configuration builds**, in a **reproducible** way.

:::

Based on a straightforward multi-version dependencies manager
built on top of **npm**, the xPack Project aims to provide a
suite of cross-platform tools. These tools are designed to manage,
**configure**, **build** and **test** complex, modular,
**multi-target** projects (encompassing multiple architecture,
boards and toolchains), in a **reproducible** way, with a
particular focus on **C/C++** and **bare-metal embedded** projects.

<details>
<summary>Where does the name come from?</summary>

Initially, the _x_ prefix used in most names came from _eXtended_.
Therefore **xPack**, pronounced _**ɛks-pæk**_, were understood as
a form of _eXtended Packages_. Similarly, **xpm** was seen as an
extended npm, and **xcdl** as an extended CDL.

Later, the meaning of **xPack** was considered to be more accurately
described as an **xpm package**.

From the programming language perspective, another way to explain
the name would be _Any Type Package_. This suggests that, unlike
npm packages (which are essentially JavaScript packages), xPacks
are more general and not restricted to a specific programming language.

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity**: By providing a suite of
cross-platform tools, the project streamlines the management,
configuration, building, and testing processes, saving time
and reducing the complexity involved in handling multi-target projects.
2. **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that builds and tests can be
executed repeatedly with identical results across different
platforms and over time enhances the reliability and stability
of the development process.
3. **Modularity and Flexibility**: The focus on complex, modular
projects allows for better organization and scalability. Developers
can work on individual components without affecting the entire
system, facilitating easier maintenance and updates.
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Tools designed to work across
various architectures, boards, and toolchains ensure that the
project can be adapted to different environments, making it
versatile and adaptable to various development needs.
5. **Specialization in C/C++ and Bare-Metal Embedded Projects**:
By targeting specific areas like C/C++ and bare-metal embedded
projects, the tools can offer specialized features and optimizations
that cater to the unique requirements of these domains.
6. **Improved Code Sharing and Reuse**: The use of a multi-version
dependencies manager built on top of npm promotes better code sharing
and reuse, enhancing collaboration and reducing duplication of effort
throughout the project lifecycle.


:::info Benefits

These benefits collectively contribute to a more efficient,
reliable, and adaptable development process, ultimately
leading to **higher quality software** and **faster time-to-market**.

## Install

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for installing the xPack tools is
an up-to-date version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
Detailed instructions for each supported platform are
available on the dedicated [Prerequisites](./prerequisites/) page.

### Core Tools

The **xPack Core Tools** can be installed automatically,
using the `npm` command. Detailed instructions for each tool are provided
in the separate
[xpm Install Guide](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/docs/install/) and
[xcdl Install Guide](https://xpack.github.io/xcdl/docs/install/) pages.

### Binary Tools

The **xPack Binary Development Tools** can be installed automatically,
using the `xpm` command
(the recommended method), or manually by downloading and unpacking one of the
platform specific archives.

Please refer to the **Install Guide** pages for each project.

## Visual Studio Code

As for GUI-based IDEs, the xPack Project prioritises integration with Visual Studio Code.

The VS Code [xPack C/C++ Managed Build](https://xpack.github.io/vscode/) extension already supports running xpm actions from the graphical interface:
